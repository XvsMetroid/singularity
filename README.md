# The Axiom Engine: A Philosophical Operating System

*A generative framework for building societies capable of continuous ethical progression, grounded in Truth, Wisdom, and Humanity.*


## Elevator Pitch

Social entropy threatens the integrity and adaptability of human systems. The Axiom Engine offers a solution: an adaptive, principle-based architecture that enables continuous ethical progression through its fractal, feedback-driven design.


## The Core Principles (The Triad)

- **Truth**: The uncompromising pursuit of verifiable reality.
- **Wisdom**: The discernment to apply truth ethically and effectively.
- **Humanity**: The principle that all action must serve human dignity, agency, and flourishing.

**Governing Axiom:** "Thou shalt not infringe."


## How it Works (The Engine)

**Feedback Loop:** `Act -> Measure -> Learn -> Adapt`

**Meta-Monitor:** A second-order process to audit the system itself for alignment drift and corruption.


## Project Status

Phase 1: Theoretical & Philosophical Inquiry — Open for critique and collaboration.
