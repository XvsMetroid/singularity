# RFC: The Measurement Problem

## Context

One of the framework's vulnerabilities is the challenge of creating non-gamed metrics for "Wisdom" and "Humanity."
How can we measure these qualities in a way that is robust, fair, and resistant to manipulation?

## Request

- Propose methods, metrics, or processes for evaluating Wisdom and Humanity in organizations or individuals.
- Share examples, critiques, or research from other fields.
- Suggest ways to audit and improve these metrics over time.
