# Copilot Instructions

This document provides instructions for AI agents interacting with The Axiom Engine repository.

## Big Picture

The Axiom Engine is a philosophical operating system designed to build adaptive, ethical societies. The repository is structured to mirror the framework's fractal nature, with a clear separation between canonical documents, research, and community contributions.

- **`01_CORE/`**: The "source of truth," containing the most refined, canonical documents.
- **`04_RESEARCH/`**: Polished articles and raw intellectual explorations.
- **`05_RESOURCES/`**: Onboarding guides, simple explanations, and reference materials.
- **`06_COMMUNITY/`**: A space for collaboration, RFCs, and open discussion.
- **`framework.yaml`**: A machine-readable summary of the core concepts.

## Developer Workflow

- **Onboarding**: Start with `05_RESOURCES/ONBOARDING.md` to understand the project's vision and reading order.
- **Contribution**: Follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, including the Contributor Ladder.
- **Community**: Engage in discussions in `06_COMMUNITY/` and respond to RFCs.
- **Versioning**: The framework is versioned in `framework.yaml` and changes are tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Project-Specific Conventions

- **Numbered Folders**: The numbered folders (`01_CORE`, `04_RESEARCH`, etc.) indicate the order of importance and provide intuitive navigation.
- **Metadata**: Documents should begin with a summary and, where possible, metadata tags (e.g., `tags: [philosophy, triad, feedback-loop]`).
- **Visuals**: Diagrams and flowcharts are created using Mermaid syntax and stored in `07_VISUALS/`.

## Integration Points

- The framework is designed to be applied to real-world organizations. See `proposals/P-05_Pilot_Program_Methodology.md` for an example.
- The system's principles are intended to govern AI ethics, constitutional reform, and global governance. See the `proposals/` folder for more.

## Key Files

- `05_RESOURCES/ONBOARDING.md`: The starting point for all contributors.
- `01_CORE/00_The_Constitution.md`: The master document for the framework.
- `framework.yaml`: The machine-readable summary of the core logic.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: A record of all significant changes.
