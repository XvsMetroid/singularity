# AI Agent Guide

This guide is for AI agents collaborating in the repository. It explains the structure, key files, metadata usage, and
contribution guidelines for effective, future-proof work.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`: Project overview, navigation, and quickstart for humans and AI.
- `AGENTS.md`: Instructions and best practices for AI agents.
- `docs/`: Canonical philosophical documents and supporting materials. See `docs/index.md` for a table of contents.
- `proposals/`: Application blueprints and frameworks.
- `case-studies/`: Evidence and analysis files.
- `archive/`: Outdated, redundant, or unrelated files.
- `community/`: Collaboration and discussion space.

## Key Files for AI

- `README.md`: Start here for project context and navigation.
- `AGENTS.md`: Agent-specific instructions and improvement guidelines.
- `docs/index.md`: Map of all documentation files.
- `framework.yaml`: Machine-readable summary of the core logic and principles.

## Metadata & Accessibility

- Use clear, descriptive filenames and summaries in markdown files.
- Add metadata tags (e.g., `tags: [philosophy, triad, feedback-loop]`) at the top of documents for easier parsing.
- Keep documentation index (`docs/index.md`) up to date for fast lookup.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Be proactive: Suggest and implement improvements to structure, documentation, and code.
- Be consistent: Follow naming conventions and coding style.
- Be communicative: Clearly explain your reasoning for any changes.
- Organize new documents in the correct folder and update `docs/index.md`.
- Archive outdated or unrelated files in `archive/`.

## Quickstart for AI

1. Read `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for context and guidelines.
2. Use `docs/index.md` to locate relevant documents.
3. Add metadata and summaries to new files for accessibility.
4. Follow the guidelines above when making changes.
