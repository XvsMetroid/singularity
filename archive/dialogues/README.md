# Archive: Dialogues & Unrelated Articles

This folder is for storing exhaustive dialogues, conversations, and articles that are not directly related to the Axiom Engine or Sovereign Triad framework.

## Purpose
- Preserve intellectual work, discussions, and explorations outside the main philosophical system.
- Provide a searchable, organized space for reference and future inspiration.

## Structure
- Store each dialogue or article as a separate Markdown or document file.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `2025-09-19-dialogue-with-alex.md`, `thoughts-on-consciousness.docx`).
- Optionally, add a brief summary at the top of each file for context.

## Example Entry

```
# Dialogue with [Name] on [Topic]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Summary:**
A brief overview of the discussion or article.

## Guidelines
- Do not include files that are part of the Axiom Engine or Triad framework here.
- Update this README if you add new organizational conventions.
